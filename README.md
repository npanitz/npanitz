## Hi, I'm Naftali ðŸ‘‹

I graduated from Binghamton University in 2019 with a BS in Biochemistry and completed an [Honors Thesis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10coccxZZO8UxcTzw2leDE39OVUxleKb3mzUzXi1OCz4/edit?usp=sharing). After I graduated, I spent a year working in a Computational Chemistry lab and developed a [data pipeline](https://github.com/npanitz/Automation-Tool-for-QM-MM-calculations-and-Image-Processing) using python and bash scripts to automate biochemical simulations using quantum mechanics tools and molecular dynamics. 
During this time, I (co)-first authored a paper in the journal of Biophysics which was recently published [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34310939/). 
I then decided to focus on developing more as a programmer and completed a full batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), and I now work at the Boyce Thompson Insitute as a Bioinformatics Software Engineer, where I work on [solgenomics](https://github.com/solgenomics/sgn)!
